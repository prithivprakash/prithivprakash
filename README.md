Hey, I’m Prithiv Prakash from India. I’m all about diving into data and building tech-driven solutions that make a real impact. Isn’t it fascinating how data and AI can transform raw information into insights?

Right now, I’m working on OptiCheML, a An AI-driven solution for optimizing the a chemical process, integrating fault detection, yield prediction, and energy harvesting from byproducts to enhance efficiency and sustainability in ammonia production. We’re using cutting-edge techniques like Support Vector Classification (SVC) for fault detection, Support Vector Regression (SVR) for yield prediction, and energy harvesting modeling from reaction byproducts to optimize the Haber-Bosch process, aiming to minimize energy consumption, improve product quality, and utilize byproducts like water, unreacted gases, and heat for generating electric energy, thus contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly production process.

I’m excited to collaborate with creative teams and innovative minds—it’s a great way to spark new ideas and learn about the latest tech. If you have any unique ideas or suggestions on how I can enhance my work, feel free to drop me a message. You can catch me on LinkedIn and GitHub. Let’s build something amazing!
